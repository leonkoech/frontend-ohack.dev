                    Sponsorship allows us to incentivize teams to complete their hackathon projects.  
                    From our previous experience over the last 9 years, in order for projects to reach completion states, 
                    we need to provide a prize with monetary value that attracts the attention of the team to 
                    follow-through. Through our sponsors, we typically can award prizes for completion to the Top 4 teams.  
                    Some teams, without any sponsorship, continue to work with their non-profit post-hackathon, 
                    but those situations are rather rare.  In an effort to continue unfinished work, we do work through 
                    local universities to sponsor follow-on projects as part of senior capstone programs.

                    How the hackathon works
                    There are 3 steps to Opportunity Hack
                    <p>
                    Step 1: Proposal - Non-profit and social enterprises will prepare a problem statement for
                     a technology project that they would like the hackathon participants to work on by completing
                      the questionnaire below.  In order to ensure that you have at least one team to work with at
                       the hackathon, we will review all submissions to select eight to ten organizations for Opportunity Hack.
                        You will be notified by September 20th if you have been selected to pitch their ideas at the hackathon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Step 2: Pre-hackathon Workshop - PayPal and its partners will host Opportunity Hack workshops to
                     help non-profits refine their problem statements and project pitches. These workshops will be conducted
                      via phone and screenshare first and follow-up sessions will occur as needed either in virtually or in person.  
                      We will reach out to you to schedule a time that works best for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Step 3: Hackathon involvement - If your project is selected, at least one knowledgeable member of your staff must be available to pitch the project to the volunteers on the first day of the hackathon and then be available by phone, email, or Slack to consult with any hackers that choose to work on your project.  The more you are available, the better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    During the hackathon, participants will create a prototype of a solution for your technology need.  The prototype will be created using open-source technologies and will be open-sourced to the public after the event.  The winning teams will have the majority of their prize money withheld until they fully complete their solution and you, the non-profit, agree that it meets their needs (you will typically tell us over Slack).
